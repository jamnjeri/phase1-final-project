* Vue 2.6.11
* Then install the various packages from package.json `npm install`
* Create environment variables

#### PROJECT DELIVERABLES
For this challenge, I worked on Machakura, a mini web application where you can browse from the available meal options and create a meal plan.

The user, is expected to be able to:

* See a home page when the webpage is first loaded
* Use the search bar to search a specific meal based on the meal name, meal id, ingredients or generate a random meal.
* Use the left hand side navigation bar to browse through the various categories provided and view the full recipe of the meal of interest. 

### CONCLUSION
* The webpage layout was difficult to deal with as it was built one item after the other and especially when the grid was added, it eventually turned out to be a difficult element to handle but it was too late to opt for something else. Also, a better home page could also have been added if more time was available.
* The deployment of the code worked as desired but the layout was slightly off when the website was accessed on a mobile device. (So it is advised, for best user experience kindly do so on a laptop or tablet)

### Languages used to create this project
* HTML,
* CSS,
* JavaScript
